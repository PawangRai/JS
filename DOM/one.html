// DOM -> Document Object Model
// First is our Window object, then document then we have two objects, head and HTML, then we can have different objects based on our page structure

// Window -> document -> HTML
// HTML -> head and body
// head -> meta tag which has an attribute and a title tag which has a text node
// body -> div which has an attribute, then we have an h1 tag which has an attribute and a text node.
// div -> the div has another paragraph tag which has a text node.

// We can manipulate any webpage by using selectors and modifying the inner HTML to our desired outcome.
